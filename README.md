# Alcohol_monitering_system_for_vehicles_using_MQ3sensor
In this project we are going to make Arduino based breathalyzer using an MQ3 alcohol sensor and an OLED Display. We can see the number of drink and drive cases in our daily life. We cannot stop people from drinking alcohol but we can minimize such accidents by keeping this simple mini breathalyzer in vehicles.
